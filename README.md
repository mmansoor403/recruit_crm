# Recruit CRM

# To Run the website
1. git clone https://github.com/mmansoor403/recruit_crm.git
2. cd recruit_crm
3. npm install
4. npm start

# Approach
1. I've made most of them as reusable components so that it can be used all over the website
2. All are complete custom CSS
3. Used React Redux for state management
